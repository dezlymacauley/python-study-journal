#### Naming Conventions in Python

**File names and folder names**
- Python files end in `.py`
- Unsuprisingly Python uses `snake_case` for file names.
- There are no explict guidelines for folder names.
- I prefer `kebab-case`. E.g. `my-python-project`

**Varible names**
- `snake case is used for`Variable namese and most variable names.

- E.g. `api_fuzzer.py`

**Making comments**
- In Python the `#` is used to make single line comments.
- Python does not support multi-line comments.
