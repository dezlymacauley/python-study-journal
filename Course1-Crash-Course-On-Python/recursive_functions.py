# NOTE: What is Recursion?

# The repeated application of the same procedure to a smaller problem
# In programming,
# recursion is a way of doing repetitive task
# by having a function call itself.

# A recursive function calls itself usually with a modified parameter,
# until it reaches a specific condition (called the base case).
